# Future Development Ideas

This directory contains strategic concepts, feature ideas, and enhancements for future consideration. These are **not currently in development** but represent potential directions for the Mind Measure platform.

## Purpose

Document all ideas discussed during development sessions, strategic planning, or user feedback that:
- Aren't immediately implementable
- Require further research or validation
- Depend on future partnerships or regulatory approval
- Represent significant scope expansion
- Are worth revisiting at a later date

## Document Structure

Each idea is documented with:

1. **Executive Summary** - One paragraph overview
2. **Problem/Opportunity** - What problem does this solve or opportunity does it unlock?
3. **Proposed Solution** - How would it work?
4. **Benefits & Risks** - Pros, cons, and potential pitfalls
5. **Requirements** - Technical, regulatory, business, or partnership needs
6. **Estimated Timeline** - When could this realistically be implemented?
7. **Dependencies** - What needs to happen first?
8. **Status** - Current state (proposed, researching, shelved, etc.)

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-feature-name.md`

Example: `2026-01-clinical-tier-partnership.md`

## Review Process

The future development backlog should be reviewed:
- Quarterly during strategic planning
- When new partnerships or opportunities arise
- When regulatory landscape changes
- When competitive intelligence suggests priority shifts

## Index

| Date | Idea | Status | Priority | Dependencies |
