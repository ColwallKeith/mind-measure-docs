## 1. About Mind Measure

Mind Measure is a multimodal conversational analytics platform designed to support student wellbeing in higher education. Through a brief daily conversation with an AI companion called Jodie, students receive a personalised wellbeing score that tracks their mental health over time — giving both the individual and their institution a clearer picture of how they are feeling.

The platform is **not** a diagnostic tool, a replacement for counselling, or a clinical intervention. It is a structured, evidence-informed monitoring system that helps universities identify emerging patterns, allocate resources more effectively, and support students before small concerns become serious problems.

### What Mind Measure Is

- A daily wellness check-in that takes 1–2 minutes
- A personal baseline assessment that establishes an individual's starting point
- A dashboard for students to track their own wellbeing
- An institutional analytics platform for aggregated, anonymised insights
- A content hub for universities to share wellbeing resources and nudges

### What Mind Measure Is Not

- A medical device or clinical diagnostic tool
- A replacement for professional mental health support
- A surveillance tool — institutions never see individual conversations
- An app that collects location data, contact lists, photos, or browsing history

## 2. Our Philosophy

Mind Measure operates on a simple principle: **early awareness leads to better outcomes**. Most students who struggle with their mental health do not seek help until they are in crisis. By providing a low-friction, non-judgemental way to reflect on how they are feeling each day, we aim to normalise the conversation around mental health and create a continuous feedback loop between students and the support systems around them.

Our approach is grounded in three commitments:

**Privacy First** — Students own their data. Individual conversations and scores are never shared with universities. Institutions receive only aggregated, anonymised analytics at cohort level.

**Evidence-Informed** — Our methodology draws on validated clinical screening instruments (PHQ-2, GAD-2) and peer-reviewed research into vocal biomarkers, facial expression analysis, and linguistic markers of wellbeing.

**Human-Centred Design** — Technology serves the conversation, not the other way around. Jodie's conversational style is warm, non-clinical, and adaptive. The experience is designed to feel like a brief check-in with a trusted companion, not a form to fill in.

## 3. How It Works

### The Student Experience

#### Baseline Assessment
When a student first uses Mind Measure, they complete a one-off baseline assessment lasting 5–10 minutes. During this conversation, Jodie asks a series of validated clinical screening questions alongside more open-ended prompts. This establishes the student's personal wellness baseline — a reference point against which all future check-ins are measured.

The clinical screening includes:
- **PHQ-2** — A two-question depression screening tool widely used in primary care (scored 0–6)
- **GAD-2** — A two-question generalised anxiety screening tool (scored 0–6)
- **Self-reported mood** — A single 1–10 scale question

These instruments are internationally validated and recommended by NICE and the American Psychiatric Association for initial screening.

#### Daily Check-ins
After the baseline, students are encouraged to check in daily. Each check-in is a brief (1–2 minute) conversation with Jodie, who asks how they are feeling, follows up on themes from previous conversations, and gently explores what is going well and what might be troubling them.

The conversation is natural and adaptive — Jodie remembers context from previous check-ins and adjusts her questions accordingly. Students speak naturally; there are no forms, scales, or multiple-choice questions in the daily check-in.

#### The Mind Measure Score
After each check-in, the platform computes a Mind Measure Score on a 0–100 scale. This score reflects the student's overall wellbeing based on a proprietary multimodal analysis of their conversation. The score is displayed on their personal dashboard alongside trends, themes, and positive drivers.

**Score ranges:**
| Range | Label | Dashboard Colour |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 80–100 | Excellent | Teal |
| 60–79 | Good | Amber |
| 40–59 | Building momentum | Coral |
| 0–39 | Support available | Deep red |

Students can also see:
- **Mood trend** — A 7-day bar chart of self-reported mood
- **Check-in streak** — How many consecutive days they have checked in
- **Insight, enjoying, and worry summaries** — What they talked about in recent check-ins
- **Previous check-in detail** — A comparison with their last conversation

#### Nudges
Universities can send short, text-based nudges to students through the app. These are brief notifications directing students to available support — a workshop on exam stress, a wellbeing drop-in session, a finance advice clinic. Nudges are prioritised by urgency and displayed as a swipeable carousel on the student dashboard.

### The Institutional Experience

#### University Dashboard
University administrators access the institutional dashboard at a secure URL. This provides aggregated, anonymised analytics across the student population, including:

- **Cohort wellbeing scores** — Average scores by department, year group, or custom cohort
- **Trend analysis** — How scores are changing over time
- **Engagement metrics** — Check-in frequency, active user counts
- **Top themes** — What students are talking about (aggregated and anonymised)
- **Risk indicators** — Proportion of students in each score zone

No individual student data is visible to institutional users. All analytics are based on aggregated data with a minimum cohort size to prevent identification.

#### Content Hub
The University Content Hub is a companion platform where administrators can:

- **Create and publish wellbeing articles** — Using a rich text editor to produce blog-style content
- **Manage nudges** — Create, schedule, and prioritise short notifications for students
- **Browse the content pool** — Access articles shared by other universities and by Mind Measure
- **View student insights** — See aggregated "Top 10" student worries and interests to inform content strategy

The Content Hub is accessed directly from the institutional dashboard with seamless authentication — no separate login required.

## 4. The Science Behind Mind Measure

### Multimodal Analysis

Mind Measure uses a multimodal approach to wellbeing assessment, combining three complementary data streams:

**Linguistic Analysis** — What students say, and how they say it. The platform analyses sentiment, word choice, engagement, coherence, and the balance of positive and negative language. Specific patterns associated with depression, anxiety, and stress are identified using natural language processing.

**Vocal Analysis** — How students sound. Research has established that vocal characteristics including pitch variability, speaking rate, pause patterns, voice energy, and vocal quality are associated with emotional state and wellbeing. These features are extracted and analysed in real time.

**Visual Analysis** — How students present. Facial expression analysis examines indicators such as smile frequency, eye contact, emotional valence, and overall engagement. These signals complement the linguistic and vocal data.

Each modality contributes to the final Mind Measure Score through a proprietary fusion algorithm. The weighting is designed to prioritise the most reliable and clinically relevant signals while gracefully handling situations where one or more modalities may be unavailable (for example, if a student's camera is off).

### Research Foundation

The assessment methodology draws on established research in:

- **Clinical screening** — PHQ-2 and GAD-2 are validated screening instruments with extensive evidence bases
- **Vocal biomarkers** — Peer-reviewed studies linking vocal characteristics to depression, anxiety, and stress
- **Facial expression analysis** — Research on facial action coding systems and their relationship to emotional state
- **Linguistic markers** — Studies on language patterns associated with psychological distress

### Important Limitations

- The Mind Measure Score is **not a clinical diagnosis**. It is a wellness indicator that should be interpreted alongside professional judgement
- Audio and visual features are research-informed but have not yet undergone independent clinical validation as standalone diagnostic instruments
- Technical factors (device quality, internet connection, ambient noise, lighting) can affect the quality of multimodal analysis
- The platform requires regular use to build a meaningful picture — isolated check-ins should be interpreted with caution
- Fusion algorithm weights represent initial calibration and will be refined through ongoing longitudinal validation

### Ongoing Research

Mind Measure is committed to continuous validation and improvement. Research priorities include:
- Longitudinal validation against established clinical measures (PHQ-9, GAD-7)
- Population norms across different demographics and institutions
- Algorithmic fairness and bias auditing across diverse populations
- Refinement of scoring weights based on outcome data

## 5. Security and Privacy

### Our Security Philosophy

Mind Measure handles sensitive wellbeing data. We treat this responsibility with the same rigour as clinical systems, implementing medical-grade security controls throughout the platform.

**Defence in Depth** — Multiple overlapping security layers ensure that no single failure compromises student data. Encryption, access controls, monitoring, and audit logging all work together.

**Least Privilege** — Every user, system, and service has access only to the minimum data required for their function. University administrators cannot access individual student conversations. Aggregated data requires minimum cohort sizes.

**Privacy by Design** — Data minimisation is built into every feature. We collect only what is necessary, retain it only as long as required, and delete it when it is no longer needed.

### Technical Security Measures

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Encryption in transit** | TLS 1.3 for all communications |
| **Encryption at rest** | AES-256 for all stored data |
| **Authentication** | Multi-factor authentication required for all administrative access |
| **Access control** | Role-based access control with granular permissions |
| **Audit logging** | Comprehensive, tamper-proof audit trails for all data access |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time security monitoring with automated alerting |
| **Backup** | Daily automated backups with 35-day retention and point-in-time recovery |
| **Disaster recovery** | Recovery time objective under 6 hours, recovery point objective under 15 minutes |

### Compliance

Mind Measure is designed to meet the requirements of:

- **UK GDPR** — Full compliance with data subject rights including access, rectification, erasure, and portability
