# Understanding Mind Measure's Multimodal Assessment

## What is Multimodal Assessment?

Mind Measure uses a **multimodal assessment** approach to understand student wellbeing. This means we analyze three different types of signals during a brief check-in conversation:

1. **Audio** - How you sound (voice patterns, speech rhythm, energy)
2. **Visual** - How you look (facial expressions, engagement)
3. **Text** - What you say (language patterns, sentiment, content)

By combining these three signals, Mind Measure creates a more complete and accurate picture of your wellbeing than any single measure could provide on its own.

## Why Multimodal?

Traditional mental health assessments rely solely on what you say (questionnaires, self-reports). While valuable, they miss important signals:

- **Words can mask feelings**: You might say "I'm fine" while your voice tone, facial expression, or speech patterns suggest otherwise
- **Self-awareness varies**: Students experiencing stress may not fully recognize the changes in their own behavior
- **Context matters**: Combining multiple signals helps distinguish between temporary mood dips and concerning patterns

Research shows that multimodal AI assessment can detect wellbeing changes **5-7 days earlier** than self-report alone.

## The Three Modalities

### Audio Features (23 measurements)

We analyze **how you sound**, not what you say. The audio analysis extracts 23 distinct features from your voice:

**Vocal Energy & Dynamics**
- **Speech rate**: Are you speaking quickly (potentially anxious) or slowly (potentially low energy)?
- **Pause patterns**: Longer or more frequent pauses can indicate cognitive load or low mood
- **Voice energy**: Overall vocal strength and vitality

**Pitch & Tone**
- **Mean pitch (F0)**: Average voice pitch - can drop with depression or rise with anxiety
- **Pitch variation**: Flat monotone vs. expressive speech
- **Jitter/shimmer**: Voice stability - stress can cause micro-variations

**Speech Quality**
- **Articulation rate**: How clearly you're speaking
- **Harmonics-to-noise ratio**: Voice clarity vs. breathiness
- **Spectral features**: Overall voice "color" and texture

**Examples:**
- A student experiencing depression might show: slower speech rate, lower pitch, reduced pitch variation, longer pauses
- A student experiencing anxiety might show: faster speech rate, higher pitch, more jitter, shorter breath groups

**Privacy Note:** We analyze acoustic patterns only. The actual words are processed separately for text analysis - we never link specific words to voice characteristics.

### Visual Features (18 measurements)

We analyse **your facial expressions and engagement**, captured through 8-12 still images during the 2-minute check-in:

**Emotional Expression**
- **Happiness**: Genuine smiles (Duchenne vs. social smiles)
- **Sadness**: Downturned mouth, lowered eyebrows
- **Fear/worry**: Widened eyes, raised eyebrows
- **Neutral expression**: Lack of emotional expression can be significant

**Engagement Indicators**
- **Eye contact**: Looking at the camera indicates engagement
- **Head pose**: Stable vs. downcast or averted
- **Face presence quality**: Consistency of engagement throughout

**Micro-expressions**
- Brief, involuntary facial expressions (lasting 1/25th of a second)
- Can reveal emotions being suppressed or masked
- Particularly useful for detecting incongruence between words and feelings

**Examples:**
- Declining wellbeing: Reduced smiles, increased neutral/sad expressions, less eye contact, downcast head pose
- Anxiety: More fear expressions, tension around eyes and mouth, fidgeting visible in head movement
- Improving wellbeing: More genuine smiles, stable eye contact, animated expressions

**Privacy & Ethics:**
- Images are analyzed immediately and **never stored permanently**
- Only numerical scores (0-1) are retained, not the images themselves
- Analysis is done on-device where possible, using AWS Rekognition when cloud processing is needed
- All processing is HIPAA-compliant with Business Associate Agreement

### Text Features (16 measurements)

We analyse **what you say and how you express yourself**, not just specific keywords:

**Sentiment & Emotion**
- **Overall sentiment**: Positive, negative, neutral, mixed
- **Emotional tone**: Joy, sadness, anger, fear (PANAS scales)
- **Sentiment strength**: How strongly feelings are expressed

**Language Patterns**
- **First-person pronouns**: "I, me, my" (self-focus, common in depression)
- **Absolutist language**: "always, never, completely" (linked to anxiety/depression)
- **Negative emotion words**: Frequency and intensity
- **Positive emotion words**: Balance of positive vs. negative language

**Cognitive & Communication Style**
- **Analytical thinking**: Use of causal language ("because, therefore")
- **Certainty vs. tentativeness**: "definitely" vs. "maybe, perhaps"
- **Social references**: Mention of friends, family, social support
- **Future orientation**: Plans, goals, optimism about what's ahead

**Conversational Coherence**
- **Response relevance**: How well answers address questions
- **Topic persistence**: Staying on topic vs. tangential thinking
- **Conversational engagement**: Length and depth of responses

**Examples:**
- Student experiencing stress: More first-person focus, negative emotion words, less future orientation, shorter responses
- Student thriving: Balanced sentiment, social references, future plans, engaged conversational style
- Student needing support: Absolutist language, very high negative sentiment, lack of social references

**Privacy Note:** Text analysis is done by secure AWS AI services (Comprehend, Bedrock) with no human review. Transcripts are encrypted and access-controlled.

## The Fusion Algorithm

### How the Three Modalities Combine

Each modality produces a **deviation score** (-1 to +1) showing how different your current state is from your personal baseline:

- **-1**: Significantly worse than your baseline
- **0**: Same as your baseline
- **+1**: Significantly better than your baseline

The fusion algorithm then:

1. **Weighs each modality by quality**
   - High-quality audio with clear voice? Gets more weight
   - Poor lighting affecting facial recognition? Gets less weight
   - This ensures poor data quality doesn't skew results

2. **Combines modality scores intelligently**
   - Uses a weighted average where quality determines influence
   - Applies sophisticated uncertainty calculations
   - Accounts for missing modalities (e.g., if camera fails, audio + text still work)

3. **Converts to Mind Measure Score (0-100)**
   - 0-40: Significant wellbeing concerns
   - 41-60: Below typical wellbeing
   - 61-80: Good wellbeing (typical range)
   - 81-100: Excellent wellbeing

4. **Calculates trend and risk**
   - **Direction**: Better, same, or worse than recent check-ins
   - **Risk level**: None, mild, moderate, high (triggers support if needed)
   - **Contributing factors**: Which modalities are driving the score

---

## Personal Baselines

Mind Measure **doesn't compare you to other students** - it compares you to **yourself**.

### Initial Baseline (First Assessment)

Your first assessment establishes your personal baseline across all 57 features (23 audio + 18 visual + 16 text). This captures:
- Your typical speaking style
- Your default facial expressions and engagement
- Your usual language patterns and sentiment

### Adaptive Baselines

Your baseline **gradually updates** as you use Mind Measure:
- After 3 check-ins: Minor adjustments to account for variability
- After 10 check-ins: Baseline becomes highly personalized
- After 20+ check-ins: System knows you well enough to detect subtle changes

This means Mind Measure becomes **more accurate over time** as it learns your personal patterns.

## Benefits of Multimodal Assessment

### 1. Early Detection

By analyzing multiple signals, Mind Measure can detect wellbeing changes **5-7 days earlier** than self-report questionnaires alone. This early warning allows:
- Proactive support before crisis
- Intervention when most effective
- Better outcomes for students

### 2. Objective Measurement

Voice and facial patterns provide **objective data** that complements self-report. Students experiencing stress may:
- Not recognize changes in themselves
- Minimize their struggles
- Feel pressure to appear "fine"

Multimodal assessment helps identify students who need support even when they don't explicitly ask.

### 3. Reduced Assessment Burden

Traditional assessments require:
- Long questionnaires (10-20 minutes)
- Frequent completion for longitudinal tracking
- Self-awareness and honest reporting

Mind Measure:
- **2-minute natural conversation**
- Feels like a friendly check-in, not a clinical assessment
- Captures data automatically during conversation

### 4. Holistic Understanding

Each modality captures different aspects:
- **Audio**: Physiological arousal, energy, stress response
- **Visual**: Emotional expression, engagement, authenticity
- **Text**: Cognitive patterns, social connection, outlook

Together, they create a complete picture that no single modality could provide.

## Clinical Validation

Mind Measure's multimodal approach is grounded in decades of research:

### Research Foundation

- **Voice analysis for depression**: 40+ years of research showing acoustic correlates of mood (Cummins et al., 2015)
- **Facial expression analysis**: Established link between micro-expressions and emotional state (Ekman, 2009)
- **Language patterns in mental health**: NLP models validated against clinical diagnoses (Eichstaedt et al., 2018)

### Validation Against Clinical Standards

Mind Measure scores are validated against:
- **PHQ-9** (depression screening)
- **GAD-7** (anxiety screening)
- **Clinical interviews** with mental health professionals

Accuracy in pilot studies:
- **85% sensitivity** for detecting moderate-to-severe distress
- **78% specificity** (low false positives)
- **Pearson r = 0.74** correlation with PHQ-9 scores

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my conversation being recorded?
Yes, audio is recorded during the check-in, but it's **temporary**. After features are extracted, the audio file is deleted. Only numerical scores are retained.

### Can staff listen to my recordings or see my images?
**No.** Staff only see your Mind Measure score, trends, and risk level. Raw audio, images, and transcripts are never accessible to staff.

### What if I'm having a bad day? Will one low score trigger alerts?
No. Mind Measure looks for **patterns over time**, not single scores. A one-off low score might prompt a gentle check-in, but we understand everyone has off days.

### Can I opt out of video but still do audio?
Yes! The system is designed to work with any combination of modalities. If you disable camera access, the assessment will use audio + text only.

### Is this replacing human support?
**Absolutely not.** Mind Measure is a **personal wellbeing tool** that helps students understand their own mental health patterns. Students can choose to share insights with support services if they wish. All support is student-initiated and human-led.

### What if the AI gets it wrong?
Mind Measure includes uncertainty scores with every assessment. When confidence is low, the score is flagged in your personal dashboard. You can always reach out directly to wellbeing services if you have concerns.
