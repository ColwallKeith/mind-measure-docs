# Conversation Screen

## Overview

The conversation screen is where students have their daily check-in with Jodie, the AI companion. It uses the ElevenLabs multimodal engine for real-time conversational AI, with voice, facial expression, and language analysis running simultaneously.

**Critical:** The ElevenLabs backend must not be modified. The conversation screen handles only the visual presentation of the exchange — all AI processing happens server-side via the existing pipeline.

## Typography

The conversation screen uses a distinctive typographic treatment designed to feel calm and readable on mobile:

### Jodie's Messages (AI)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Font | Lato |
| Weight | 700 (bold) |
| Size | 40px |
| Colour | White (`#FFFFFF`) |
| Alignment | Left |
| Line height | 1.2 |

### User's Messages

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Font | Lato |
| Weight | 300 (light) |
| Size | 22px |
| Colour | Sinbad (`#99CCCE`) at 0.8 opacity |
| Alignment | Left |
| Line height | 1.4 |

### Emphasis Words

Certain words in Jodie's messages are highlighted:

- **User's name** — Always italicised in Sinbad colour
- **Emotion words** (e.g. "manageable", "stressed") — Italicised in Sinbad
- **References** (e.g. "Last time", "1-10") — Italicised in Sinbad
- **"Finish button"** — Triggers the Finish button to go solid

Emphasis is detected via:
1. Asterisk-wrapped phrases from the AI transcript (`*word*`)
2. Hard-coded patterns: user's name, "last time", numeric scales, emotion vocabulary

### Speaker Label

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Text | "JODIE" or "YOU" |
| Font | Inter |
| Size | 12px |
| Weight | 600 |
| Colour | Sinbad at 0.6 opacity |
| Position | Top-left above message |

## Message Timing

### User Message Hold

User responses take longer to transcribe than Jodie's pre-prepared text. To prevent user messages being knocked off screen before they're read:

- When a user message appears, it holds for a minimum of **2.5 seconds**
- Jodie's next message queues and displays after the hold period
- Jodie's own messages transition immediately (they're the primary content)

### Scroll Behaviour

- Messages appear with the latest at the bottom, scrolling upward
- Previous messages fade to ~20% opacity as they scroll up
- Generous bottom padding ensures new text appears in the comfortable reading zone, not jammed against the screen bottom

## Finish Button

The Finish button has two states:

| State | Appearance | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Outline** | Hollow border, Spectra colour | Default from start |
| **Solid** | Filled Spectra background, white text | When Jodie says "finish button" in her transcript |

The solid state includes a haptic pulse to draw attention. The button requires a deliberate tap — accidental touches are prevented by a brief debounce.

## Background

The entire conversation screen uses a Spectra (`#2D4C4C`) background, creating an immersive, focused environment. The camera and microphone icons sit at the bottom-left. The Finish button sits at the bottom-right.

## Assessment Flow

After the student taps Finish:

1. Conversation ends
2. Transition to the [Processing Screen](/mobile/processing-screen)
3. Assessment data is submitted to the analysis pipeline
4. On completion, the student returns to the dashboard with updated scores
