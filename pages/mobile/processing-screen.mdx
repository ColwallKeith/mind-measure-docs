# Processing Screen

## Overview

The processing screen plays after a student taps "Finish" on the conversation screen. It provides a 10–15 second typographic animation while the assessment pipeline analyses their check-in data. Regardless of how long the actual processing takes, the animation runs to completion before transitioning to the dashboard.

## Animation Sequence

The screen displays a series of phrases using rich typography — varied weights, sizes, and colours — that scroll upward like film credits. The effect conveys that meaningful analysis is happening.

### Phrases

The processing phrases rotate through reassuring, descriptive messages:

```
"Listening to your words..."
"Reading between the lines..."
"Understanding your mood..."
"Analysing your expressions..."
"Building your picture..."
"Measuring your wellbeing..."
"Preparing your insights..."
"Almost there..."
```

### Typography Treatment

Each phrase uses a different combination from the brand palette:

| Element | Style |
|---|---|
| Key words | Large (36–48px), bold (700), white or Sinbad |
| Supporting words | Medium (24–28px), light (300), Pampas at 0.7 opacity |
| Emphasis words | Italicised, Buttercup or Sinbad |

Phrases scroll upward with a slow, deliberate pace — approximately one phrase every 1.5 seconds. Previous phrases fade to transparency as they move up.

### Closing Sequence

After the phrase animation:

1. All text fades out
2. The Mind Measure logo fades in at centre screen (2-second hold)
3. Logo dissolves to reveal the dashboard underneath

The transition to the dashboard uses a cross-fade rather than a hard cut, creating a sense of arrival.

## Technical Implementation

The animation runs on a fixed timer (not tied to API response time):

- If the assessment pipeline finishes before the animation, results are cached and applied when the dashboard renders
- If the pipeline is still running when the animation ends, the dashboard loads with the previous data and updates when results arrive
- The student always sees the full animation — it is never cut short

## Background

Full-screen Spectra (`#2D4C4C`) background, consistent with the conversation screen. The transition from conversation → processing is seamless (same background colour).
