### Score-State Colour Mapping

The poster hero background colour changes based on the user's wellbeing score:

| State | Score Range | Background | Text Colour | Affirmation |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Low | &lt; 40 | `#FF6B6B` (Bittersweet) | `#ffffff` | "Something needs attention." |
| Mid | 40–59 | `#F59E0B` (Buttercup) | `#2D4C4C` | "Let's build momentum." |
| Stable | 60–79 | `#99CCCE` (Sinbad) | `#2D4C4C` | "You're doing great." |
| High | 80+ | `#DDD6FE` (Lilac) | `#2D4C4C` | "Strong momentum." |

### Design Philosophy — Gulf Racing Livery

The palette was inspired by the Ford GT in Gulf Racing livery — precision, pride, performance, but inviting. Sinbad + Apricot are deliberately confident, gender-neutral, and performance-oriented. These are not "wellness pastels" — they are iconic colours that signal quality.

> *"Just a reminder — these colours are iconic car colours although not, on the surface, 'aggressive' at all."*

### Core Typographic Principle

The **contrast between light uppercase labels** (11px, 300 weight, wide tracking, muted opacity) and **heavy data numbers** (28–285px, 900 weight, tight tracking) is the personality of the app:

> *"That's the personality of the app — the contrast between the Light labels and Black data."*

## Kinetic Typography System

Jodie's AI responses include `*asterisks*` around emotionally resonant words. The `renderEmphasis()` function parses these and renders them with visual emphasis.

```
Input:  "That's *really* good to hear."
Output: "That's " + <em style="italic, sinbad, +6px">really</em> + " good to hear."
```

### Rendering Rules

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Font style | Italic |
| Font weight | 400 (slightly heavier than surrounding 300) |
| Colour | Sinbad (`#99CCCE`) accent |
| Size bump | Base font size + 6px (34px → 40px) |
| Spacing | If followed by punctuation: `marginRight: 2px` |

### Production Integration

1. Add to Jodie's system prompt: *"Use \*asterisks\* around emotionally resonant or key words to indicate natural spoken emphasis. Use sparingly — typically 1–3 words per response."*
2. Call `renderEmphasis()` when rendering AI message text
3. Cap at ~3 emphasized words per message

## Design Philosophy

### "Strava meets Headspace"

Confident, data-forward, not patronising. Users should feel like they're using a high-quality performance tool, not a therapeutic intervention.

> *"Should NOT be too touchy feely... hoping we are going to see young men engaging."*

### "Simple Surface, Depth on Demand"

Every dashboard element is a tappable card that opens to a detailed modal. The surface layer shows the minimum — score, mood number, streak count. Tap for the full picture.

### Score-State Colour as Differentiator

> *"An app that changes colour based on how you're feeling is instantly differentiating. No other wellbeing app does this."*

### The Five Hero Screens

1. **Dashboard** (Poster Hero)
2. **Check-in** (Lyrics Scroll)
3. **Profile** (Wellbeing Report)
4. **Content** (Editorial)
5. **Loading/Splash**

> *"If we can set the tone with these then everything else will fall in behind."*

### Safeguarding Priority

"Need Help?" is always visible on the dashboard — never hidden behind menus. Someone in crisis should not have to hunt for it.

### Phone-First Design

> *"This will be viewed 100% on a phone — contrast will be important."*
