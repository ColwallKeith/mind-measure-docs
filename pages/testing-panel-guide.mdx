### Test Scheduling

Tests can be run:
- **On-Demand**: Manual execution via UI
- **Scheduled**: Automated daily/weekly runs
- **Triggered**: Event-based execution
- **Continuous**: Real-time monitoring

## Interpreting Test Results

### Status Indicators

- ¢ **Operational**: All tests passing
-  **Warning**: Minor issues detected
- ´ **Critical**: Immediate attention required
-  **Unknown**: Test not yet run

### Compliance Scoring

- **100%**: Fully compliant
- **75-99%**: Minor compliance gaps
- **50-74%**: Significant issues
- **`<50%`**: Major compliance failure

### Vulnerability Severity

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate patching required
- **HIGH**: Patch within 7 days
- **MEDIUM**: Patch within 30 days
- **LOW**: Patch at next maintenance window

## Security Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- User login/logout flows
- MFA enrollment and verification
- Role-based access validation
- Session timeout testing

### 2. Data Protection

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Connection Errors
```bash
# Check database connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/database/health

# Verify environment variables
echo $VITE_DB_HOST
echo $VITE_DB_NAME
```

### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Test Cognito connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/test

# Verify user pool configuration
echo $VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
```

### Audit Log Issues
