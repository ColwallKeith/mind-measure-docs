# Baseline Assessment

## Overview

The baseline assessment establishes a user's personal wellness baseline through a structured conversation that includes validated clinical screening questions. This is typically completed once when a user first joins the platform.

## Clinical Questions

The baseline assessment includes five standardised questions:

### PHQ-2 (Depression Screening)
1. **"Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?"**
 - Not at all (0)
 - Several days (1)
 - More than half the days (2)
 - Nearly every day (3)

2. **"Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?"**
 - Not at all (0)
 - Several days (1)
 - More than half the days (2)
 - Nearly every day (3)

### GAD-2 (Anxiety Screening)
3. **"Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge?"**
 - Not at all (0)
 - Several days (1)
 - More than half the days (2)
 - Nearly every day (3)

4. **"Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by not being able to stop or control worrying?"**
 - Not at all (0)
 - Several days (1)
 - More than half the days (2)
 - Nearly every day (3)

### Mood Scale
5. **"On a scale of 1 to 10, where would you say your mood is today?"**
 - 1 (Very low) to 10 (Excellent)

## Score Calculation

### Clinical Composite Score

The clinical component uses a composite formula:

```typescript
// PHQ-2 Component (0-6 scale → 0-21 contribution)
const phq2Component = (6 - phq2Total) * 3.5;

// GAD-2 Component (0-6 scale → 0-21 contribution)
const gad2Component = (6 - gad2Total) * 3.5;

// Mood Component (1-10 scale → 0-50 contribution)
const moodComponent = moodScale * 5;

// Clinical Score (0-100)
const clinicalScore = phq2Component + gad2Component + moodComponent;
```

### Multimodal Enrichment

For baseline assessments, the clinical score is enriched with multimodal features:

```
Final Score = (Clinical Score × 0.70) + (Audio Score × 0.15) + (Visual Score × 0.15)
```

If visual features fail to extract:
```
Final Score = (Clinical Score × 0.85) + (Audio Score × 0.15)
```

## Implementation

### Component: BaselineAssessmentSDK.tsx

The baseline assessment uses the ElevenLabs SDK:

```typescript
import { useConversation } from '@elevenlabs/react';

const BaselineAssessmentSDK = ({ userId, onComplete }) => {
 const conversation = useConversation({
 onMessage: handleMessage,
 onDisconnect: handleComplete
 });
 
 const startAssessment = async () => {
 await conversation.startSession({
 agentId: 'agent_9301k22s8e94f7qs5e704ez02npe'
 });
 };
 
 // ... rest of implementation
};
```

### Response Extraction

Clinical responses are extracted from the conversation transcript using pattern matching:

```typescript
const extractMoodScore = (transcript: string): number => {
 // Handles numeric ("8") and word numbers ("eight")
 const patterns = [
 /(?:mood|score|rate).*?(\d+|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten)/i,
 /(?:I(?:'d| would) (?:say|put|rate).*?)(\d+|one|two|three|...)/i
 ];
 // ... extraction logic
};
```

## Data Stored

The baseline assessment stores:

```json
{
 "assessment_type": "baseline",
 "clinical_scores": {
 "phq2_total": 1,
 "gad2_total": 1,
 "mood_scale": 7,
 "phq2_positive_screen": false,
 "gad2_positive_screen": false
 },
 "conversation_quality": "complete",
 "elevenlabs_session_id": "conv_xxxx",
 "mind_measure_composite": {
 "score": 77,
 "phq2_component": 21,
 "gad2_component": 21,
 "mood_component": 35
 },
 "multimodal_enrichment": {
 "enabled": true,
 "audio_features": { ... },
 "visual_features": { ... },
 "scoring_breakdown": {
 "clinicalScore": 77,
 "audioScore": 25,
 "visualScore": 40,
 "finalScore": 64
 }
 }
}
```

## Clinical Interpretation

### PHQ-2 Screening
- **Score 0-2**: Negative screen (low risk)
- **Score 3-6**: Positive screen (warrants further assessment)

### GAD-2 Screening
- **Score 0-2**: Negative screen (low risk)
- **Score 3-6**: Positive screen (warrants further assessment)

**Important**: These are screening tools, not diagnostic instruments. A positive screen should prompt referral to appropriate clinical resources.
