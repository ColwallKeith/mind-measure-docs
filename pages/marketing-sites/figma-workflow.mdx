# Figma to Code Workflow

## Overview

Marketing site pages are designed in Figma and built using **Figma Make** (React output) or hand-coded from Figma designs. Figma is the source of truth for page layouts, visual structure, and design system.

The current approach uses **Relume** for wireframing/structure, then **Figma Sites** for building production pages.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Wireframe in Relume

- Define page structure, sections, and content hierarchy
- Establish information architecture
- Generate initial layout for refinement in Figma

### Step 2: Design in Figma

- Refine layouts using shared Mind Measure design system
- Apply brand colours, typography, and spacing
- Design responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Prepare assets (images, icons, illustrations)

### Step 3: Build with Figma Sites / Figma Make

- **Figma Sites** – Build directly from Figma designs; includes hosting and a built-in CMS for blogs (under review)
- **Figma Make** – Export React components from designs for use in a custom-hosted site

### Step 4: Deploy

- **Figma Sites:** Publish directly from Figma
- **Custom build:** Push React code to GitHub → Vercel deploys automatically

## Design System

### Shared Across All Sites

All Mind Measure marketing sites share a common design system defined in Figma:

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **University colour** | Blue (#0066CC) |
| **Student colour** | Purple (#8B5CF6) |
| **Pro/Workplace colour** | Green (#059669) |
| **Display font** | Chillax |
| **Body font** | Geist |
| **Monospace font** | PP Mori |
| **Base grid** | 8px |
| **Container max-width** | 1280px |

### Naming Conventions

Figma layers map to React components:
- `Button/Primary` → `<PrimaryButton />`
- `Card/Blog` → `<BlogCard />`
- `Section/Hero` → `<HeroSection />`

## Asset Export

### Images

- **Format:** WebP (with PNG fallback)
- **Sizes:** Desktop (1920px), Tablet (1024px), Mobile (768px)
- **Naming:**

```
assets/images/
  hero-university-desktop.webp
  hero-university-tablet.webp
  hero-university-mobile.webp
```

### Icons

- **Format:** SVG
- **Source:** Figma component library
- **Usage:** Inline or as React components

## Pages to Build

### Currently Live (to be rebuilt from Figma)

- Home page (university and student variants)

### New Pages (designed in Figma)

- About
- How it works
- The science behind it
- Contact
- Privacy policy
- How Buddies work
- Mind Measure Pro (workplace – 2026)

## Blog Integration

Blog pages (listing and individual posts) pull content from the Marketing CMS via public API. The page templates and styling come from Figma designs, but the content is dynamic.

**Note:** Figma Sites includes a built-in CMS for blogging. This is being evaluated as a potential alternative to the Marketing CMS for marketing site blogs. See [CMS & Content Management](/marketing-sites/cms-enhancement) for details.

## Time Estimates

| Page Type | Estimated Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| Simple page (About, Contact) | 2-4 hours |
| Complex page (Home, How it works) | 4-8 hours |
| Blog template (list + post) | 4-6 hours |
