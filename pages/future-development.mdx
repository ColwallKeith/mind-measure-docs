# Future Development

A living document tracking planned features, deferred work, and development priorities across the Mind Measure platform. Items are grouped by product area and roughly ordered by priority within each section.

## Mobile App

### Settings Page (Phase 2)

**Status**: Deferred — minimal version deployed  
**Repository**: `mind-measure-mobile-final`  
**Current State**: Settings page stripped back to essentials (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Your Privacy overlay, Sign Out) as of January 2026. The original implementation was off-brand, non-functional, and crashed on interaction due to a stub `useUserPreferences` hook.

**Planned Work**:

1. **On-brand design** — Settings page must match the mobile app's visual language. No generic icons or emojis. Consistent typeface and colour palette.
2. **Notification preferences** (persisted to database):
   - Check-in reminders — opt in/out of daily wellness check-in prompts
   - Buddy notifications — control whether buddies can check in on you
   - Wellbeing alerts — toggle important wellbeing updates
3. **Privacy preferences** (persisted to database):
   - Data sharing — consent for anonymised research data sharing
4. **Backend requirements**:
   - `user_preferences` table in Aurora (or extend `profiles` table)
   - `useUserPreferences` hook rewritten to read/write via `backendService.database`
   - Preferences synced on login, cached locally for offline access
5. **Appearance settings** (lower priority):
   - Dark mode — requires full theme system across the mobile app
   - Reduced motion — requires animation wrapper/context
   - Only implement when the rest of the app supports these features
6. **Assessment preferences** (lower priority):
   - Voice vs text input preference for check-ins
   - Only relevant once the assessment engine supports both modalities

**Design Notes**: The Figma designs for the mobile app should be consulted when this work begins. The settings page should feel native to iOS/Android, not like a web form.

### Buddy System Enhancements

**Status**: V1 deployed (email-only)  
**Repository**: `mind-measure-mobile-final`

**Planned Work**:

- In-app notifications when a buddy accepts an invitation
- Buddy status visibility on the dashboard
- Push notification integration for nudge reminders
- Potential V2: in-app messaging between student and buddy

---

## Admin Dashboard (Core)

### Investor Dashboard

**Status**: Planned — Figma designs exist  
**Repository**: `mind-measure-core`

**Planned Work**:

- Dedicated investor-facing view with key platform metrics
- User growth, engagement trends, university adoption
- Revenue and cost data (if appropriate)
- Figma designs available in the project files — consult before implementation

---

### University Invite Flow

**Status**: Implemented — needs end-to-end testing  
**Repository**: `mind-measure-core`

**Planned Work**:

- Full end-to-end test of the university admin invite flow
- Verify email delivery, code entry, and successful access
- Confirm university admins can then invite their own users
- Document the flow once validated

---

## Platform-Wide

### Type Safety Enhancement

**Status**: Planned (previously Phase 5)  
**Applies to**: Both `mind-measure-core` and `mind-measure-mobile-final`

**Planned Work**:

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Centralised type definitions for database schemas and API responses
- Runtime validation with Zod
- Type-safe service interfaces
- See archived `PHASE_5_PLAN.md` for full details

---

### Push Notification Infrastructure

**Status**: Not started  
**Applies to**: `mind-measure-mobile-final` (Capacitor), backend (AWS)

**Planned Work**:

- FCM/APNs token registration via Capacitor
- Backend service for sending targeted push notifications
- Notification types: check-in reminders, buddy nudges, wellbeing alerts, crisis escalation
- User preference integration (once settings page Phase 2 is complete)
- Scheduling engine for timed reminders

## How to Use This Document

- Add new items as they are identified and deferred
- Update status as work progresses
- Move completed items to the relevant product documentation
- Keep the "Last Updated" date current
- This is not a sprint backlog — it captures medium-to-long-term planned work
